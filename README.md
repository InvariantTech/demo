## Demo networks

This collection of network configs serve as examples for working with Invariant. Some of these examples are unmodified copies of the example networks found in the [pybatfish](https://github.com/batfish/pybatfish/tree/master/jupyter_notebooks/networks) repository. Others were generated for this example repository using Arista AVD.

The 'enterprise' example is re-published with permission from Radovan Brezula. See [https://brezular.com/2017/09/07/enterprise-network-on-gns3-part-1-introduction/](https://brezular.com/2017/09/07/enterprise-network-on-gns3-part-1-introduction/) .
